1,"Entropy and Self-Organization in Multi-Agent Systems
ABSTRACT
Emergent self-organization in multi-agent systems appears to 
contradict the second law of thermodynamics. This paradox has 
been explained in terms of a coupling between the macro level 
that hosts self-organization (and an apparent reduction in 
entropy), and the micro level (where random processes greatly 
increase entropy). Metaphorically, the micro level serves as an 
entropy ""sink,"" permitting overall system entropy to increase 
while sequestering this increase from the interactions where self-organization
is desired. We make this metaphor precise by 
constructing a simple example of pheromone-based coordination, 
defining a way to measure the Shannon entropy at the macro 
(agent) and micro (pheromone) levels, and exhibiting an entropy-based
view of the coordination.
INTRODUCTION
Researchers who construct multi-agent systems must cope with 
the world's natural tendency to disorder. Many applications 
require a set of agents that are individually autonomous (in the 
sense that each agent determines its actions based on its own state 
and the state of the environment, without explicit external 
command), but corporately structured. We want individual local 
decisions to yield coherent global behavior.
Self-organization in natural systems (e.g., human culture, insect 
colonies) is an existence proof that individual autonomy is not 
incompatible with global order. However, widespread human 
experience warns us that building systems that exhibit both 
individual autonomy and global order is not trivial.
Not only agent researchers, but humans in general, seek to impose 
structure and organization on the world around us. It is a universal 
experience that the structure we desire can be achieved only 
through hard work, and that it tends to fall apart if not tended. 
This experience is sometimes summarized informally as 
""Murphy's Law,"" the observation that anything that can go 
wrong, will go wrong and at the worst possible moment. At the 
root of the ubiquity of disorganizing tendencies is the Second Law
of Thermodynamics, that ""energy spontaneously tends to flow 
only from being concentrated in one place to becoming diffused 
and spread out."" [9]
Adding energy to a system can overcome the Second Law's 
""spontaneous tendency"" and lead to increasing structure. 
However, the way in which energy is added is critical. Gasoline in 
the engines of construction equipment can construct a building 
out of raw steel and concrete, while the same gasoline in a bomb 
can reduce a building to a mass of raw steel and concrete.
Agents are not immune to Murphy. The natural tendency of a 
group of autonomous processes is to disorder, not to organization. 
Adding information to a collection of agents can lead to increased 
organization, but only if it is added in the right way. We will be 
successful in engineering agent-based systems just to the degree 
that we understand the interplay between disorder and order.
The fundamental claim of this paper is that the relation between 
self-organization in multi-agent systems and thermodynamic 
concepts such as the second law is not just a loose metaphor, but 
can provide quantitative, analytical guidelines for designing and 
operating agent systems. We explain the link between these 
concepts, and demonstrate by way of a simple example how they 
can be applied in measuring the behavior of multi-agent systems. 
Our inspiration is a model for self-organization proposed by 
Kugler and Turvey [7], which suggests that the key to reducing 
disorder in a multi-agent system is coupling that system to another 
in which disorder increases. Section 2 reviews this model and 
relates it to the problem of agent coordination. Section 3 describes 
a test scenario that we have devised, inspired by self-organization 
in pheromone systems, and outlines a method for measuring 
entropy in this scenario. Section 4 reports our experimental 
results. Section 5 summarizes our conclusions.

AN ENTROPY MODEL FOR SELF-ORGANIZATION
In the context of biomechanical systems, Kugler and Turvey [7] 
suggest that self-organization can be reconciled with second-law 
tendencies if a system includes multiple coupled levels of 
dynamic activity. Purposeful, self-organizing behavior occurs at 
the macro level. By itself, such behavior would be contrary to the 
second law. However, the system includes a micro level whose 
dynamics generate increasing disorder. Thus the system as a 
whole is increasingly disordered over time. Crucially, the 
behavior of elements at the macro level is coupled to the micro 
level dynamics. To understand this model, we begin with an 
example, then abstract out the underlying dynamics, and finally 
comment on the legitimacy of identifying processes at this level 
with principles from thermodynamics.

2.1  An Example: Pheromones
The parade example of such a system is the self-organization of an 
insect colony (such as the construction of minimal spanning tree 
networks among nests and food sources by ants, or the erection of 
multi-storied structures with regularly spaced pillars and floors by 
tropical termites), through pheromone-based coordination [1, 11]. 
Pheromones are scent markers that insects use in two ways. First, 
they deposit pheromones in the environment to record their state. 
For example, a foraging ant just emerging from the nest in search 
of food might deposit nest pheromone, while an ant that has found 
food and is carrying it will deposit food pheromone. ([15] 
documents use of multiple pheromones by insects.) Second, they 
orient their movements to the gradient of the pheromone field. In 
the example of foraging ants, those seeking food climb the 
gradient of the food pheromone, while those carrying food climb 
the gradient of the nest pheromone. The most realistic models of 
the ants' pheromone-climbing behavior incorporates a stochastic 
element in their movement. That is, they do not follow the 
gradient deterministically, but use its strength to weight a roulette 
wheel from which they determine their movement.
The environment in which pheromones are deposited plays a 
critical role in such a system. It is not passive, but active, and 
performs three information-processing functions with the 
pheromones.
1. It
aggregates deposits of the same flavor of pheromone from
different ants, thus providing a form of data fusion across 
multiple agents at different times, based on their traversal of 
a common location.
2. It
evaporates pheromones over time, thus forgetting obsolete
information. This dynamic is usefully viewed as a novel 
approach to truth maintenance. Conventional knowledge 
bases remember every assertion unless there is cause to 
retract it, and execute truth maintenance processes to detect 
and resolve the conflicts that result when inconsistent 
assertions coexist. Insect systems forget every assertion 
unless it is regularly reinforced.
3.  Evaporation provides a third function, that of disseminating
information from the location at which it was deposited to 
nearby locations. An ant does not have to stumble across the 
exact location at which pheromone was deposited in order to 
access the information it represents, but can sense the 
direction from its current location to the pheromone deposit 
in the form of the gradient of evaporated pheromone 
molecules.
2.2  The Model in Detail
In the Kugler-Turvey model, ants and their movements constitute 
the macro level of the system, while pheromone molecules 
constitute the micro level. The purposeful movement of ants, 
constructing minimal paths among their nests and food sources, 
achieve a reduction in disorder at the macro level, made possible 
because the agents at this level are coupled to the micro level, 
where the evaporation of pheromone molecules under Brownian 
motion results in an overwhelming growth in disorder. As a result, 
the disorder of the overall system increases, in keeping with the 
Second Law, in spite of the emergence of useful order at the 
macro level.
Figure 1 illustrates the interplay among these processes, and how 
this model of agent coordination differs from more classical 
views. Classically, agents are considered to perceive one another 
directly, reason about this perception, and then take rational 
action. The Kugler-Turvey model views coordination as being 
mediated by an environment that agents change by their actions 
(e.g., depositing pheromones), a process known as ""stigmergy""  
[4]. Processes in the environment generate structures that the 
agents perceive, thus permitting ordered behavior at the agent 
level. At the same time, these processes increase disorder at the 
micro level, so that the system as a whole becomes less ordered 
over time. 
Research in synthetic pheromones [2, 12, 13] draws directly on 
this model of coordination, but the model is of far broader 
applicability. In a multi-commodity market, individual agents 
follow economic fields generated by myriad individual 
transactions, and self-organization in the demand and supply of a 
particular commodity is supported by an environment that 
distributes resources based on the other transactions in the system. 
The movement of currency in such a system provides similar 
functions to those of pheromones in insect systems. More broadly, 
we hypothesize that a coupling of ordered and disordered systems 
is ubiquitous in robust self-organizing systems, and that the lack 
of such a coupling correlates with architectures that do not meet 
their designers' expectations for emergent cohesiveness.
2.3 A Caveat
At this point, readers with a background in physics and chemistry 
may be uneasy. These disciplines formulated the Second Law 
within a strict context of processes that result in energy changes. 
The fundamental physical measures associated with the second 
law are temperature T, heat Q, and (thermodynamic) entropy S, 
related by the definition

Thus defined, thermodynamic entropy has strong formal

where i ranges over the possible states of the system and p

similarities have led to a widespread appropriation of the notion 
of ""entropy"" as a measure of macro-level disorder, and of the 
Second Law as describing a tendency of systems to become more 
chaotic. Our approach participates to this appropriation.
It has been objected [8] that such appropriation completely 
ignores the role of energy intrinsic to both thermodynamic 
definitions (via T and dQ in the macro definition and k in the 
micro definition). Such an objection implicitly assumes that 
energy is logically prior to the definition, and that unless 
information processes are defined in terms of energy changes, it is 
illegitimate to identify their changes in entropy with those of 
thermodynamics. An alternative approach to the question would 
argue that in fact the prior concept is not ergs but bits, the 
universe is nothing but a very large cellular automaton with very 
small cells [3, 6], and physics and chemistry can in principle be 
redefined in terms of information-theoretic concepts. Our 
approach is sympathetic with this view. While we are not prepared 
at this point to define the precise correspondence between ergs 
and bits, we believe that physical models are an under-exploited 
resource for understanding computational systems in general and 
multi-agent systems in particular. The fact that the thermodynamic 
and information approaches work in different fundamental units 
(ergs vs. bits) is not a reason to separate them, but a pole star to 
guide research that may ultimately bring them together.
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We experiment with these concepts using a simple model of 
pheromone-based behavior. In this section we describe the 
experiment and how one measures entropy over it.
3.1  The Coordination Problem
Consider two agents, one fixed and one mobile, who desire to be 
together. Neither knows the location of the other. The mobile 
agent, or walker, could travel to the destination of the stationary 
one, if it only knew where to go. The stationary agent, or target, 
deposits pheromone molecules at its location. As the pheromone 
molecules diffuse through the environment, they create a gradient 
that the walker can follow. 
Initially, the walker is at (30,30) and the target is at (50,50) in a 
100x100 field. Every time step, the target deposits one molecule 
at (50,50). Both the walker and the pheromone molecules move 
by computing an angle
[0,2] relative to their current heading
and taking a step of constant length (1 for the walker, 2 for the 
pheromone molecule) in the resulting direction. Thus both 
molecules and walkers can be located at any real-valued 
coordinates in the field. Molecules move every cycle of the 
simulation and the walker every five cycles, so altogether the 
molecules move ten times as fast as the walker. Molecules fall off 
of the field when they reach the edge, while the walker bounces 
off the edges.
Molecules choose the heading for their next step from a uniform 
random distribution, and so execute an unbiased random walk. 
The walker computes its heading from two inputs.
1.  It generates a gradient vector
Gr
from its current location to
each molecule within a specified radius
, with magnitude
Equation 4

&lt;
=

i
r

where  r
i
is the distance between the walker and the ith
molecule and g is a ""gravitational constant"" (currently 1).
2.  It generates a random vector
Rr
with random heading and
length equal to a temperature parameter T.
The vector sum
R
G
r
r +
, normalized to the walker's step length
(1 in these experiments), defines the walker's next step. Including
Rr
in the computation permits us to explore the effectiveness of
different degrees of stochasticity in the walker's movement, 
following the example of natural pheromone systems. 
The state of the walker defines the macro state of the system, 
while the states of the molecules define the micro state. This 
model can easily be enhanced in a number of directions, including 
adding multiple walkers and multiple targets, and permitting 
walkers and targets to deposit pheromone molecules of various 
flavors. The simple configuration is sufficient to demonstrate our 
techniques and their potential for understanding how the walker 
finds the target.
3.2 Measuring Entropy
Computing the Shannon or Information Entropy defined in 
Equation 3 requires that we measure  
1.  the set of states accessible to the system and  
2.  the probability of finding the system in each of those states.
3.2.1  Measuring the Number of System States
In most computational systems, the discreteness of digital 
computation makes counting system states straightforward 
(though the number of possible states is extremely high). We have 
purposely defined the movement of our walker and molecules in 
continuous space to highlight the challenge of counting discrete 
system states in an application embedded in the physical world 
(such as a robotic application). Our approach is to superimpose a 
grid on the field, and define a state on the basis of the populations 
of the cells of the grid.  
We can define state, and thus entropy, in terms either of location 
or direction. Location-based state is based on a single snapshot of 
the system, while direction-based state is based on how the system 
has changed between successive snapshots. Each approach has an 
associated gridding technique. 
For location-based entropy, we divide the field with a grid. Figure 
2 shows a 2x2 grid with four cells, one spanning each quarter of 
the field. The state of this system is a four-element vector 
reporting the number of molecules in each cell (in the example, 
reading row-wise from upper left, &lt;1,1,3,2&gt;. The number of 
possible states in an nxn grid with m particles is n
2m
.  The
parameters in location-based gridding are the number of divisions 
in each direction, their orientation, and the origin of the grid.
126
Rectangular grids are easiest to manage computationally, but one 
could also tile the plane with hexagons. 
For direction-based entropy, we center a star on the previous 
location of each particle and record the sector of the star into 
which the particle is found at the current step. Figure 3 shows a 
four-rayed star with a two particles. The state of the system is a 
vector with one element for each particle in some canonical order. 
Counting sectors clockwise from the upper left, the state of this 
example is &lt;2,3&gt;. The number of possible states with an n-pointed
star and m particles is mn. The parameters in direction-based
gridding are the number of rays in the star and the rotation 
of the star about its center. 
In both techniques, the analysis depends critically on the 
resolution of the grid (the parameter n) and its origin and 
orientation (for location) or rotation (for direction). 
To understand the dependency on n, consider two extremes. If n is 
very large, the chance of two distributions of particles on the field 
having the same state is vanishingly small. For N distributions,
each will be a distinct state, each state will have equal probability 
1/N, and the entropy will be log(N). This state of affairs is clearly 
not informative. At the other extreme, n = 1, all distributions 
represent the same state, which therefore occurs with probability 
1, yielding entropy 0, again not informative. We choose the 
gridding resolution empirically by observing the length scales 
active in the system as it operates. 
To understand the dependency on origin/orientation or rotation, 
consider two particles in the same cell. After they move, will they 
still be in the same cell (keeping entropy the same) or in different 
cells (increasing entropy)? Exactly the same movements of the 
two particles could yield either result, depending on how the grid 
is registered with the field. We follow Gutowitz's technique [5] of 
measuring the entropy with several different origins and taking the 
minimum, thus minimizing entropy contributions resulting from 
the discrete nature of the grid.
3.2.2  Measuring the Probabilities
In principle, one could compute the probability of different 
system states analytically. This approach would be arduous even 
for our simple system, and completely impractical for a more 
complex system. We take a Monte Carlo approach instead. We 
run the system repeatedly. At each step in time, we estimate the 
probability of each observed state by counting the number of 
replications in which that state was observed. The results reported 
here are based on 30 replications.  
Shannon entropy has a maximum value of log(N) for N different 
states, achieved when each state is equally probable. To eliminate 
this dependence on N, we normalize the entropies we report by 
dividing by log(N) (in our case, log(30)), incidentally making the 
choice of base of logarithms irrelevant.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We report the behavior of entropy first in the micro system, then 
in the unguided and guided macro system, and finally in the 
complete system.
4.1  Entropy in the Micro System
Figure 4 shows locational entropy in the micro system (the 
pheromone molecules), computed from a 5x5 grid. Entropy 
increases with time until it saturates at 1. The more molecules 
enter the system and the more they disperse throughout the field, 
the higher the entropy grows. Increasing the grid resolution has no 
effect on the shape of this increase, but reduces the time to 
saturation, because the molecules must spread out from a single

location and the finer the grid, the sooner they can generate a 
large number of different states. 
Directional entropy also increases with time to saturation. This 
result (not plotted) can be derived analytically. The molecule 
population increases linearly with time until molecules start 
reaching the edge. Then the growth slows, and eventually reaches 
0. Let M be the population of the field at equilibrium, and 
consider all M molecules being located at (50,50) through the 
entire run. Initially, all are stationary, and each time step one 
additional molecule is activated. Then the total number of 
possible system states for a 4-star is 4M, but the number actually 
sampled during the period of linear population growth is 4t, since 
the stationary molecules do not generate any additional states. 
Thus the entropy during the linear phase is log(4t)/log(4M). As 
the growth becomes sublinear, the entropy asymptotically 
approaches 1, as with locational entropy.
4.2  Entropy in the Unguided Macro System
Figure 5 shows the path of a walker uncoupled to the micro 
system (when the target is emitting no pheromone molecules). 
With no coupling to the micro field, the walker is just a single 
molecule executing a random walk. Figure 6 shows that locational 
entropy for this walker increases over time, reflecting the 
increased number of cells accessible to the walker as its random 
walk takes it farther from its base. The grid size (15 divisions in 
each direction) is chosen on the basis of observations of the 
guided walker, discussed in the next section.
The directional entropy (not plotted) is constant at 1, since the 
walker chooses randomly at each step from all available 
directions.
4.3  Entropy in Guided Macro System
Now we provide the walker with a micro field by emitting 
pheromone molecules from the target. Figure 7 shows the path 
followed by a typical walker with radius
= 20 and T = 0. This
path has three distinct parts. 
Ј  Initially, the walker wanders randomly around its origin at
(30,30), until the wavefront of molecules diffusing from 
(50,50) encounters its radius. In this region, the walker has 
no guidance, because no molecules are visible.
Ј  Once the walker begins to sense molecules, it moves rather
directly from the vicinity of (30,30) to (50,50), following the 
pheromone gradient.
Ј  When it arrives at (50,50), it again receives no guidance from
the molecules, because they are distributed equally in all 
directions. So it again meanders.
The clouds of wandering near the start and finish have diameters 
in the range of 5 to 10, suggesting a natural grid between 20x20 
and 10x10. We report here experiments with a 15x15 grid. 
Because of their initial random walk around their origin, walkers 
in different runs will be at different locations when they start to 
move, and will follow slightly different paths to the target (Figure 
8).

Figure 8. Ensemble of Guided Walkers (
= 20, T = 0)
128
The dots in Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the directional and 
locational entropies across this ensemble of guided walkers as a 
function of time. The solid line in each case plots the normalized 
median distance from the walkers to the target (actual maximum 
28), while the dashed line plots the normalized median number of 
molecules visible to the walkers (actual maximum 151). The lines 
show how changes in entropy and reduction in distance to the 
target are correlated with the number of molecules that the walker 
senses at any given moment. 
At the beginning and end of the run, when the walkers are 
wandering without guidance, directional entropy is 1, 
corresponding to a random walk. During the middle portion of the 
run, when the walker is receiving useful guidance from the micro 
level, the entropy drops dramatically. As the temperature 
parameter T is increased in the range 50 to 100, the bottom of the 
entropy well rises, but the overall shape remains the same (plot 
not shown). 
The locational entropy presents a different story. The 
minimization method for avoiding discreteness artifacts has the 
effect of selecting at each time step the offset that best centers the 
cells on the walkers. At the beginning of the run and again at the 
end, most walkers are close together, and fall within the same cell 
(because we chose a cell size comparable to these clouds). 
Walkers leave the starting cloud at different times, since those 
closer to the target sense the pheromones sooner, and follow
different paths, depending on where they were when the 
pheromone reached them. Thus they spread out during this 
movement phase, and cluster together again once they reach the 
target. The effect of raising T to 100 on locational entropy is that 
the right end of the curve rises until the curve assumes a similar 
shape (plot not shown) to Figure 6. 
Comparison of Figure 6 and Figure 10 shows that though the 
directed portion of the walker's movement has higher entropy 
than the undirected portions, coupling the walker to the micro 
level does reduce the walker's overall entropy. Even at its 
maximum, the entropy of the guided walker is much lower than 
that of the random one, demonstrating the basic dynamics of the 
Kugler-Turvey model. 
The different behavior of locational and directional entropy is 
instructive. Which is more orderly: a randomly moving walker, or 
one guided by pheromones? The expected location of a random 
walker is stationary (though with a non-zero variance), while that 
of a guided walker is non-stationary. In terms of location, the 
random walker is thus more regular, and the location entropy 
reflects this. However, the movement of the guided walker is more 
orderly than that of the random walker, and this difference is 
reflected in the directional entropy. This difference highlights the 
importance of paying attention to dynamical aspects of agent 
behavior. Our intuition that the guided walker is more orderly 
than the random one is really an intuition about the movement of 
this walker, not its location.
4.4  Entropy in the Overall System
Central to the Kugler-Turvey model is the assertion that entropy 
increase at the micro level is sufficient to ensure entropy increase 
in the overall system even in the presence of self-organization and 
concomitant entropy reduction at the micro level. Our experiment 
illustrates this dynamic. As illustrated in Figure 4, by time 60, 
normalized entropy in the micro system has reached the maximum 
level of 1, indicating that each of the 30 replications of the 
experiment results in a distinct state. If each replication is already 
distinct on the basis of the locations of the pheromone molecules 
alone, adding additional state elements (such as the location of the 
walker) cannot cause two replications to become the same. Thus 
by time 60 the normalized entropy of the entire system must also 
be at a maximum. In particular, decreases in macro entropy, such 
as the decrease in locational entropy from time 80 on seen in 
Figure 10, do not reduce the entropy of the overall system. 
One may ask whether the reduction in macro (walker) entropy is 
causally related to the increase in micro entropy, or just 
coincidental. After all, a static gradient of pheromone molecules 
would guide the walker to the target just as effectively, but would 
be identical in every run, and so exhibit zero entropy. This 
argument neglects whatever process generates the static gradient 
in the first place. An intelligent observer could produce the 
gradient, but then the behavior of the system would hardly be 
""self-organizing."" In our scenario, the gradient emerges as a 
natural consequence of a completely random process, the random 
walk of the pheromone molecules emerging from the target. The 
gradient can then reduce the entropy of a walker at the macro 
level, but the price paid for this entropy reduction is the increase 
in entropy generated by the random process that produces and 
maintains the gradient.

One may also ask whether our hypothesis requires a quantitative 
relation between entropy loss at the macro level and entropy gain 
at the micro level. A strict entropy balance is not required; the 
micro level might generate more entropy than the macro level 
loses. In operational terms, the system may have a greater capacity 
for coordination than a particular instantiation exploits. What is 
required is that the entropy increase at the micro level be 
sufficient to cover the decrease at the macro level, and this we 
have shown.

SUMMARY
To be effective, multi-agent systems must yield coordinated 
behavior from individually autonomous actions. Concepts from 
thermodynamics (in particular, the Second Law and entropy) have 
been invoked metaphorically to explain the conditions under 
which coordination can emerge. Our work makes this metaphor 
more concrete and derives several important insights from it. 
Ј  This metaphor can be made quantitative, through simple state
partitioning methods and Monte Carlo simulation.
Ј  These methods show how coordination can arise through
coupling the macro level (in which we desire agent self-organization
with a concomitant decrease in entropy) to an 
entropy-increasing process at a micro level (e.g., pheromone 
evaporation). Our demonstration focuses on synthetic 
pheromones for the sake of expositional simplicity, but we 
believe that the same approach would be fruitful for 
understanding self-organization with other mechanisms of 
agent coordination, such as market systems.
Ј  This confirmation of the Kugler-Turvey model encourages us
as agent designers to think explicitly in terms of macro and 
micro levels, with agent behaviors at the macro level coupled 
in both directions (causally and perceptually) to entropy-increasing
processes at the micro level.
Ј  Some form of pheromone or currency is a convenient
mechanism for creating such an entropy-increasing process.
Ј  Researchers must distinguish between static and dynamic
order in a multi-agent system. We have exhibited a system 
that appears intuitively to be self-organizing, and shown that 
the measure of order underlying this intuition is dynamic 
rather than static.

2,"Diagnosis of TCP Overlay Connection Failures using Bayesian Networks
ABSTRACT
When failures occur in Internet overlay connections today, it is difficult
for users to determine the root cause of failure. An overlay
connection may require TCP connections between a series of overlay
nodes to succeed, but accurately determining which of these
connections has failed is difficult for users without access to the
internal workings of the overlay. Diagnosis using active probing
is costly and may be inaccurate if probe packets are filtered or
blocked. To address this problem, we develop a passive diagnosis
approach that infers the most likely cause of failure using a
Bayesian network modeling the conditional probability of TCP failures
given the IP addresses of the hosts along the overlay path. We
collect TCP failure data for 28.3 million TCP connections using
data from the new Planetseer overlay monitoring system and train
a Bayesian network for the diagnosis of overlay connection failures
. We evaluate the accuracy of diagnosis using this Bayesian
network on a set of overlay connections generated from observations
of CoDeeN traffic patterns and find that our approach can
accurately diagnose failures.
INTRODUCTION
When failures occur in Internet overlay connections today, it is
difficult for users to determine the root cause of failure. The proliferation
of TCP overlays such as content distribution networks
and HTTP proxies means that frequently network communication
requires a series of TCP connections between overlay nodes to succeed
. For example, an HTTP request using the CoDeeN[9] content
distribution network first requires a TCP connection to a CoDeeN
node and then a connection from a CoDeeN node to a server or another
CoDeeN node. A failure in any one of the TCP connections
along the overlay path causes the user's HTTP request to fail. If
the user knows which TCP connection failed, then they can take
appropriate action to repair or circumvent the failure. For instance,

if they know that the connection from the proxy to the server failed,
then they complain to the web server administrator. On the other
hand, if the user/proxy connection fails, perhaps they can try connecting
to the proxy using a different ISP. If multiple overlay paths
exist between the source and destination, nodes and applications
may also use this type of diagnostic information to automatically
recover or route around failures[1].
Unfortunately, accurately determining which TCP connection in
an overlay connection has failed is difficult for end users, who typically
do not have access to the internal workings of the overlay.
Commercial overlay networks such as Akamai typically do not reveal
details of connection failures to users, and the diagnostic tools
available to users today are frequently inadequate. Active probing
techniques such as tulip[7] and Planetseer[11] frequently cannot
provide accurate information due to firewalls and packet filtering.
Furthermore, active probing can be costly both in terms of network
resources and time, and cannot diagnose the many transient TCP
failures that begin and end before one can complete a probe[11].
Additionally, one must take care when using active probing for diagnosis
because they may concentrate network traffic at points of
failure and trigger intrusion detection systems.
Instead, in our research we consider a passive approach to diagnosis
in which intelligent diagnostic agents use probabilistic inference
to determine the root cause of failure. The reliability of IP
links in the Internet varies widely and hence we expect the probability
of TCP failure to differ between different sets of hosts. Diagnostic
agents in the Internet learn the probability of such failures
for different regions in the Internet based on observations of TCP
traffic. When users or network administrators detect network failures
, they request diagnosis from such diagnostic agents. Agents
then use information about the relative probability of failure of the
TCP connections that make up an overlay connection to identify
the most likely cause of failure when an overlay connection occurs
without conducting any additional probes. In addition, diagnostic
agents can also use this Bayesian network to predict the probability
of overlay and TCP connection failure given information about the
path of an overlay connection.
We collect data on TCP failure probabilities in order to determine
whether this data enables diagnostic agents data to accurately
diagnose overlay failures in the Internet. To learn the probability
of failure for TCP connections between different points in the network
, we observe TCP traffic on the content distribution network
CoDeeN using an updated version of Planetseer[11]. Next we construct
a Bayesian network for diagnosis using these probabilities.
We then use Bayesian inference to infer the most probable cause of
failure for TCP-based applications.
To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we test this Bayesian
network on an artificial set of overlay connections based on the
305
traffic observed on CoDeeN. We find that when a failure occurs,
knowing only the AS numbers of the source, proxy, and destination
, we can determine which TCP connection has failed with over
80% probability. In addition, the probability of failure between
ASes stays relatively constant over time, and data learned can be
accurately used for diagnosis for many hours into the future. This
suggests that the TCP failure probabilities we learn may be useful
in the diagnosis of future failures as well.
The contribution of this research is to show how inter-AS TCP
failure probabilities can be used for probabilistic diagnosis of failures
in overlay networks such as CoDeeN using Bayesian inference
. We also demonstrate a variety of clustering methods to address
the problem of dataset sparsity for learning TCP failure probabilities
. In this paper we evaluate our system on CoDeeN overlay
connections, but our Bayesian model generalizes to the diagnosis
of other TCP-based applications as well.
RELATED WORK
There has been previous work in passive diagnosis of failures
in the Internet. Padmanabhan, Ramabhadran, and Padhye developed
Netprofiler, which collects network measurements from a set
of end hosts and attempts to identify cause of failure by examining
the shared dependencies among hosts that experience failures[8].
They show that this approach can provide information useful for
diagnosis, but their paper only provides some preliminary results
and do not provide details of how their system might diagnose real-world
failures in practice.
Shrink probabilistically diagnoses IP link failures based on the
observed status of IP links that share resources[4]. Similarly in our
work we diagnose failures in overlay connections where an overlay
depends on several underlying TCP connections which may share
IP hops. Shrink assumes that one can accurately determine the status
of all IP links at any point in time. This allows one to identify
the shared cause of failure of the failed IP links. Theoretically, we
can also use this approach to diagnose overlay failures. That is, we
can identify the TCP connections that share common IP hops and
observe which overlay connections have failed at any point in time
to identify the failed TCP connections.
Unfortunately, in real-world diagnosis of TCP connections many
of the assumptions made by systems such as Shrink do not hold for
the following reasons.
1. The status of overlay connections may change rapidly, making
it difficult to correlate failures in different overlay connections
over time.
2. In order to construct a Bayesian network that accurately models
the IP hops shared among different TCP connections we
need an accurate IP level map of the Internet. As the Skitter
1
project demonstrates, accurately constructing such a map is
difficult because routes may change and frequently tools such
as traceroute do not provide accurate information.
3. Determining the status of an inactive overlay connection or a
TCP connection is costly and takes time because it requires
an active probe such as a ping, traceroute, or HTTP connection
. Furthermore such probes are frequently inaccurate because
of the prevalence of packet filtering, network address
translation (NAT), and firewalls in the Internet[3].
4. TCP and IP failures are frequently so transient that by the
time one can test the status of a link, the failure no longer
exists [11].

http://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/skitter/
Therefore in this paper we present an alternative passive diagnosis
approach that does not require simultaneously knowing the
status of all overlay connections. Instead, we cluster TCP failures
based on the Internet autonomous systems (ASes) of their endpoints
and use information about the distribution of TCP failures
to infer the cause of failure. An agent first learns a probabilistic
model of failures based on a training set of observed TCP connections
, and then it uses this model to diagnose future failures when
it does not know the connection status.
Other researchers have developed methods for diagnosing specific
TCP-based applications. Ward, et al. infer the presence of
TCP performance failures based on the rate of requests processed at
an HTTP proxy server and TCP connection state [10]. Unlike such
specialized diagnostic systems, our Bayesian approach to diagnosis
can generalize to other applications that rely on TCP connections.
Most previous research in probabilistic diagnosis of Internet failures
evaluate their work on simulated failures. Steinder and Sethi
model network faults using a bipartite causality graph in which the
failure of individual links cause the failure of end-to-end connec-tivity
, and then perform fault localization using a belief network[6].
In contrast, in our research we evaluate our approach on real-world
TCP failures using actual data collected on the Internet.
DIAGNOSING OVERLAY CONNECTION FAILURES
In this paper we consider the diagnosis of overlay networks in
which an overlay network connection requires a series of TCP connections
between overlay nodes between the source and destination
hosts. For example, Akamai is a content distribution network
in which retrieving a resource from a web server may requ ire
communication among multiple Akamai nodes along multiple TCP
connections. Another example is the content distribution network
CoDeeN on Planetlab, in which overlay nodes act as HTTP proxies
. An request on CoDeeN[9] first requires a TCP connection to a
CoDeeN node and then a connection from a CoDeeN node to server
or another CoDeeN node. A failure in any one of these TCP connections
causes the user's HTTP connection to fail. The challenge
is to determine which of these TCP connections has failed.
Sometimes users can determine whether a failure has occurred
along the first TCP connection along the overlay path using information
provided by their local TCP stack, but if a failure occurs
beyond the first connection users cannot tell where a failure occurs
without cooperation from the overlay. Depending on the type of
overlay, users may have different amounts of information about the
overlay path. For example, in an HTTP proxy connection, users
know that the proxy is the first hop along the path and that if the
connection is not cached, the web server is the last hop along the
path.
As a first step, in our research we examine a special case of diagnosis
in order to gain insight into how well our approach might
generalize to other types of diagnosis. The question we wish to answer
is, if a two hop overlay connection fails due to a TCP failure,
which TCP connection failed? In this paper we define a TCP failure
as three consecutive TCP retransmits without a response. We
assume that the diagnostic agent only knows that the overlay connection
has failed and does not know which of the TCP connections
has failed. We want to answer this question knowing only the IP addresses
of the source, IP address of the first hop overlay node, and
the IP address of the ultimate overlay destination host. Our model
for probabilistic diagnosis generalizes to overlay connections with
any number of hops, but as a starting point in this paper we only
consider overlay connections with two hops.

Probabilistic Diagnosis
The reliability of IP links in the Internet varies widely and hence
we expect the probability of TCP failure to differ between different
sets of hosts. Thus if we have knowledge of the relative probability
of failure of the TCP connections that make up an overlay connection
, we can then infer the most likely cause of failure when
an overlay connection occurs without conducting any additional
probes. In this paper we show we can use Bayesian networks both
to learn a model of TCP failures and to perform diagnosis.
Bayesian networks compactly represent the conditional probability
of related events and enable efficient inference based on available
evidence[5]. A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph
in which nodes represent variables, and edges from parent nodes to
children nodes represent dependence relations. Each node X has a
conditional probability table (CPT) P
(X|parents(X)) that encodes
the conditional probability of X given evidence about its parents.
Bayesian networks have several important features that make
them especially suitable for reasoning about failures in the Internet
. Firstly, Bayesian networks can model both deterministic and
probabilistic dependencies among many types of Internet components
and diagnostic tests. For example, an HTTP proxy connection
functions if and only if the user/proxy TCP connection functions
and the proxy/provider TCP connection functions. The probability
that a TCP connection functions depends on the source and
destination IP addresses and the time of the connection. To improve
accuracy, we cluster IP addresses by AS and connection time
by hour (see section 3.2). Figure 1 illustrates a Bayesian network
that encodes the conditional probabilities for diagnosing an overlay
connection from A to B to C. To diagnose an overlay connection
failure from A to C, one can use this Bayesian network to infer the
most probable status of the underlying TCP connections from A to
B and B to C given information about the AS numbers and hour the
connections were made.
The variables in the Bayesian network represent the functional
status of TCP connections and overlay connections. A node in
this Bayesian network represents the functional status of a connection
: OK if functioning, Failed if malfunctioning. Malfunctioning
means that a connection failure occurs along the path, functioning
means that no connection failure occurs. Edges in the Bayesian network
represent dependencies among connections. The CPT for an
overlay connection node represents the probability that it is functioning
given the status of its underlying TCP paths. The CPT for
a TCP path represents the probability that the TCP path functions
given information about the path. In our Bayesian network we assume
that the conditional probability of a TCP connection failure
depends only on the source and destination IP addresses and the
time of failure for each hop of the overlay, and not on which hop
of the overlay connection it is (user/proxy or proxy/server). We
represent this by using parameter tying in this Bayesian network
so that both TCP paths share the same CPT. We also assume that a
diagnostic agent can identify the intermediate hops in the overlay
connection, either through active probing or because it has knowledge
of the overlay topology.
An advantage of modeling network components in terms of Bayesian
networks is that a Bayesian network provides an abstract high-level
representation for diagnostic data suitable for reasoning. Representing
diagnostic data in terms of variables, evidence, and dependencies
rather than passing around low-level measurements such as
packet traces allows an agent to reason about the causes and consequences
of failures without any deep knowledge of the behavior
and characteristics of components and diagnostic tests. In addition,
the conditional independence assumptions of Bayesian inference
reduce the amount of data a diagnostic agent needs to consider for
diagnosis.
3.2
Clustering
To perform diagnosis using this Bayesian network, we need to
learn the conditional probability of failure of a TCP connection
given the properties of a connection. Learning the conditional probability
of failure for each pair of IP addresses is impractical because
it is infeasible to store the probability of failure for the 2
64
combinations
of source and destination IP addresses. More importantly,
for each pair of IP addresses we only have a limited amount of data
with which to train the Bayesian network. For more effective diagnosis
, diagnostic agents need a way to diagnose failures involving
IP addresses it has not previously observed.
Therefore to reduce the size of the conditional probability tables
and to improve the accuracy of the learned probabilities, we
cluster together IP addresses in a way that facilitates learning and
diagnosis. Our hypothesis is that TCP connections that share many
IP links with one another will have similar probabilities of failure
. Thus two TCP connections with topologically nearby sources
and nearby destinations will likely have similar failure probabilities
. Therefore we clustered source and destination IP addresses in
three ways: by the first eight bits of the IP address, the AS number,
and by country.
We also cluster TCP connections based on time. We hypothesize
that the probability of failure changes over multiple time scales.
For instance, if an IP routing change occurs, the probability of failure
for affected TCP connections may change from low to high and
back to low within a few minutes. On the other hand, the average
rate of routing failure over several days may remain relatively
constant. We show how different methods for clustering affect the
accuracy of diagnosis in section 5.
COLLECTING TCP FAILURE DATA
It is difficult to obtain accurate information about the distribution
of TCP failures in the Internet because failed connections make
up only a small percentage of overall TCP traffic and the number
307
of possible source and destination IP addresses is enormous. To
collect accurate failure probabilities, we need a way to observe the
status of large quantities of TCP connections from many different
source and destination hosts.
In order to obtain such data, we used an updated version of Planetseer
to collect data on TCP connection failures. The new Planetseer
monitors TCP connections in the CoDeeN content distribution
network and provides notifications when TCP sessions begin, end,
and when TCP failures occur. Planetseer runs on over 320 Planetlab
[2] nodes distributed around the world. We used Planetseer to
monitor all the TCP connections made by 196 CoDeeN nodes. We
observed 28.3 million TCP connections and 249,000 TCP failures
over a ten hour period. We observed TCP connections to approximately
17,000 distinct IP addresses per hour on average. In our
dataset, we observed TCP connections to hosts in 2116 unique Internet
autonomous systems.
CoDeeN overlay nodes act as HTTP proxies and establish TCP
connections with web clients, web servers, and other CoDeeN nodes.
In a typical CoDeeN session, a user initiates a TCP connection with
the CoDeeN proxy, the proxy connects to a web server and retrieves
the requested resource, and finally the proxy sends the requested
data back to the user. Note that many requests are cached, and so
the destination of the second hop in the overlay is a CoDeeN node
and not the web server specified in the HTTP request. We found
that 0.28% of user/proxy connections and 0.65% of proxy/server
connections experienced TCP failures. Since Planetseer monitors
TCP connections from the vantage point of the proxy, we cannot
detect those TCP failures in which a user is unable to establish a
TCP connection to the proxy. Therefore the lower percentage of
user/proxy failures may be partly explained by the fact that all failures
between the proxy and user occur after the user successfully
establishes a TCP connection to the proxy.
We believe that the failure probabilities learned through Planetseer
are representative of typical TCP connections in the Internet
. CoDeeN nodes operate as HTTP proxies, so the pattern of
TCP connections resembles typical web traffic. Though caching at
CoDeeN nodes reduces the number of connections to web servers
we observe, we believe that the average failure probability to web
servers we observe using Planetseer reflects typical failure rates for
HTTP related TCP connections. We are currently examining other
types of overlay connections to determine how well this TCP data
generalizes for the diagnosis of other overlays.
We learn the conditional probability table for TCP connection
failure using the data collected from Planetseer. We cluster source
and destination IP addresses by AS using the Oregon Route Views
BGP tables
2
.
EVALUATION
Our hypothesis is that Bayesian inference using the conditional
probability of failure for TCP connections given the AS numbers of
the source and destination can accurately diagnose failures in overlay
connections. In order to test this hypothesis, we constructed a
Bayesian network using the probabilities learned from Planetseer
and used it to diagnose failures in CoDeeN connections.
We wanted to answer the following questions in our experiments:
1. Which clustering method produces the most accurate diagnosis
: AS, IP/8 prefix, or country? We expect that clustering
based on AS will produce the most accurate results since it
is most closely correlated with the Internet routing topology.
2
http://www.routeviews.org/
2. How does diagnostic accuracy change as we increase the
time interval over which we cluster TCP connections? We
expect that as the clustering interval increases, accuracy will
increase at first, but then decrease as the learned probabilities
less accurately reflect the probabilities of new failures.
3. How does the age of the training set affect diagnostic accuracy
? We expect that as the distribution of TCP failures in
the Internet changes over time, diagnostic accuracy will also
decrease.
5.1
Experimental Setup
We train a Bayesian network using the Bayes Net Toolbox (BNT)
for Matlab
3
. In order to diagnose TCP connections between regions
we did not observe in the training set, we initialize the prior probabilities
of failure according to a uniform Dirichlet distribution,
which is equivalent to adding an additional element to the training
set for each combination of source cluster, destination cluster,
and connection status. We test this Bayesian network on an artificial
dataset generated based on the distribution of TCP connections
observed on Planetseer. Since Planetseer does not provide information
about which TCP connections are associated with each
CoDeeN request, we construct a dataset based on the TCP connections
we observed. First we identify user/proxy, proxy/proxy,
and proxy/server connections based on IP address and port number
. Then for each proxy, we count the number of TCP connections
to each server and to each proxy. We assume that the number
of cached requests equals the number of user/proxy connections
minus the number of proxy/server and proxy/proxy connections
. We assign each user/proxy TCP connection a corresponding
proxy/provider connection, where the provider may either be a web
server (if the resource is not cached), another proxy (if the resource
is cached at another proxy), or the same proxy (if the resource is
cached locally). We make these provider assignments according to
the observed distribution of proxy/server and proxy/proxy connections
. Of the 19,700 failures in this dataset, approximately 82%
of requests are cached locally, 7.9% are cached at other CoDeeN
nodes, and 10.6% are uncached.
For each CoDeeN request failure our Bayesian network makes
two diagnoses: one for the status of the user/proxy connection, and
one for the status of the proxy/provider connection. We measure
accuracy in terms of the fraction of correct diagnoses. To evaluate
the accuracy of diagnosis, we compute the most probable explanation
for a TCP failure given evidence that the overlay connection
has failed and the AS numbers of the source, proxy, and destination
, and then compare this diagnosis with the actual status of the
source/proxy and proxy/provider connections. In our experiments
we perform diagnosis without evidence about whether a resource is
cached at a proxy.
Of the CoDeeN requests that failed in the first hour of our dataset,
we found that 62% failed at the user/proxy connection, 31% failed
at the proxy/server connection, and 7% failed at a the proxy/proxy
connection. Therefore knowing only the overall distribution of
TCP failures between users and servers, without using information
about the IP addresses of the user, proxy, and server, one could diagnose
failures with 62% accuracy by diagnosing every failure as
a user/proxy failure. In our experiments we wish to determine if
our Bayesian approach to diagnosis can achieve significantly better
accuracy.
In order to properly compute the accuracy of diagnosis, we sepa-rated
the set of TCP connections with which we trained the Bayesian
network from the set of TCP connections associated with the failed

TCP connection data from Planetseer. In our initial experiments
we choose to learn the average probability of failure over one hour
because we find that clustering over shorter time scales does not
provide enough data for accurate diagnosis.

Experimental Results
First we compare the accuracy of three IP clustering methods:
by Internet autonomous system number (AS), by the first eight bits
of the IP address (IP), and by the country in which a host resides
(Country). We determine the country of a host using the hostip.info
database
4
, which maps the first 24 bits of an IP address to a country
using location information contributed by Internet users. We
train three Bayesian networks corresponding to the three clustering
methods using data from hour 1. Then we test these Bayesian
networks on the proxy connection failures constructed using data
from hours 2≠10 and averaged the results. We use a junction tree
inference engine to compute the most likely status for each TCP
connection and compare the inferred status with the actual status
from the data. Since the Bayesian network we use for inference
has no cycles, we can perform Bayesian learning and junction tree
inference rapidly; in our experiments, inference for a single connection
requires approximately 5 ms.

Figure 4: Accuracy vs. Training Set Age
Figure 2 compares the diagnostic accuracy of these three clustering
approaches. We define accuracy as the fraction of correct
status inferences. As a baseline, we also plot the accuracy of simply
guessing that every failure is due to a user/proxy connection
failure. Figure 2 shows that all three clustering methods provide
similar degrees of accuracy. Our hypothesis was that clustering
based on AS would produce the most accurate results, but our experiments
show that clustering based on the first 8 bits of the IP
address yields higher accuracy for short time intervals. This may
be because one hour is not enough time to accurately learn inter-AS
TCP failure probabilities, or due to inaccuracies in the Route Views
BGP table.
Next we computed the accuracy of diagnosis as we increase the
time interval over which we cluster TCP connections. If the interval
over which we train is too short, then we will not have enough data
to accurately learn failure probabilities. If the interval is too long,
then it may not accurately reflect changing network conditions. We
train a Bayesian network using AS clustering on x hours before
hour 10 for values of x from 1 to 9. We then test each Bayesian
network on the data from hour 10. Figure 3 shows how accuracy
changes as the training time interval changes. This plot shows that
accuracy increases as the clustering time interval increases, suggesting
that the training value of incorporating additional data outweighs
the inaccuracy introduced by using older data.
Finally, we compute the accuracy of diagnosis as we increase the
age of the data on which we trained the Bayesian network. We train
a Bayesian network using AS clustering on data from hour 1 and
test it on overlay failures observed during each of the hours from
2 to 10. Figure 4 plots the accuracy of diagnosis over time. Average
accuracy changes over time because the distribution of failures
we observe using Planetseer varies from hour to hour, but overall
diagnostic accuracy diminishes only slightly after nine hours, suggesting
that the distribution of TCP failure probabilities remains
relatively stationary over time.
We also compare the false positive and false negative rates for
each clustering method. The false positive rate is the fraction of
functioning connections that are incorrectly diagnosed as having
failed, while the false negative rate is the fraction of failed connections
that are incorrectly diagnosed as functioning. Table 1 lists the
false positive and false negative rates for each clustering method.

failures knowing only the AS numbers of its TCP endpoints.

Table 1: Diagnosis error rates by type
One reason our approach to diagnosis works is due to the heavy-tailed
distribution of TCP connection failure probability. The majority
of TCP failures occur among a small number of AS pairs.
Therefore most CoDeeN connection failures involve one TCP connection
with low failure probability and another TCP connection
with high failure probability, so probabilistic inference produces
the correct diagnosis. For example, we find that TCP connections
from hosts in China to hosts in the USA tend to have a much
higher probability of failure than connections within the USA. If
an CoDeeN user in China accesses a proxy in the USA to retrieve
content from a web server in the USA and experiences a failure,
then it is very likely that the failure occurred on the connection between
the user and the CoDeeN node. If the probability of failure
for every pair of ASes were equal, then our probabilistic approach
to diagnosis would not work as well.
Another interesting result is that the accuracy of diagnosis diminishes
relatively slowly over time, implying that the distribution
of TCP failures in the Internet stays relatively stationary over time.
This suggests that diagnostic agents can perform accurate diagnosis
using inter-AS TCP failure probabilities without having to con-stantly
collect the latest TCP failure data.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Our initial experimental results indicate that our passive probabilistic
approach to diagnosing TCP overlay connection failures
can provide useful diagnostic information. In this paper we show
that Bayesian inference provides a useful framework for diagnosing
two hop overlay connection failures on CoDeeN, but our approach
can generalize to the diagnosis of other overlay connection
failures as well. We view our approach to diagnosing TCP overlay
connection failures as just one example of a more general probabilistic
approach for Internet fault diagnosis. In this paper we show
how to use inter-AS TCP failure probabilities to diagnose failures
in overlay networks, but the technique we used to diagnose failures
in CoDeeN can be extended to the diagnosis of other overlays as
well. We can apply the knowledge we learned from Planetseer to
diagnose other classes of network components and applications by
adding new nodes and edges to the Bayesian network we use for
diagnosis.
In this paper we only considered diagnosis without using any additional
evidence about a failure. Typically, however, when failures
occur users may already know the status of certain network components
and can perform diagnostic probes to collect additional evidence
for diagnosing failures. We can improve the accuracy of our
approach by adding variables and edges to the Bayesian network to
take into account this information. For instance, if we know the IP
paths that TCP connections traverse, we can incorporate evidence
of IP link failures into the Bayesian network. We intend to explore
how agents can incorporate such additional evidence into a
Bayesian network to improve diagnostic accuracy.
In future work we will also examine more accurate models for
Internet fault diagnosis that take into account failures at both short
and long time scales. In this paper we only evaluated our algorithm
on ten hours of data from Planetseer; we would like to conduct additional
experiments to more accurately determine the effectiveness
of diagnosis using data from other time periods as well. In addition
we would like to explore other clustering methods, including dy-namically
choosing the prefix length on which to cluster based on
how much data an agent has about TCP connections to a particular
IP range.
Finally, though our paper describes a centralized diagnosis approach
, this approach can easily be adapted for distributed diagnosis
. Knowledge of the overlay topology and the conditional probabilities
in the CPTs can be distributed among multiple agents in
the Internet, allowing different agents to collect failure data from
different points in the network. We are currently developing such a
distributed system for the diagnosis of TCP application failures in
the Internet.

3,"Efficient Multi-way Text Categorization via Generalized Discriminant Analysis
ABSTRACT
Text categorization is an important research area and has been receiving
much attention due to the growth of the on-line information
and of Internet. Automated text categorization is generally cast as
a multi-class classification problem. Much of previous work focused
on binary document classification problems. Support vector
machines (SVMs) excel in binary classification, but the elegant
theory behind large-margin hyperplane cannot be easily extended
to multi-class text classification. In addition, the training time and
scaling are also important concerns. On the other hand, other techniques
naturally extensible to handle multi-class classification are
generally not as accurate as SVM. This paper presents a simple and
efficient solution to multi-class text categorization. Classification
problems are first formulated as optimization via discriminant analysis
. Text categorization is then cast as the problem of finding coordinate
transformations that reflects the inherent similarity from the
data. While most of the previous approaches decompose a multiclass
classification problem into multiple independent binary classification
tasks, the proposed approach enables direct multi-class
classification. By using Generalized Singular Value Decomposition
(GSVD), a coordinate transformation that reflects the inherent class
structure indicated by the generalized singular values is identified.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness
of the proposed approach.

INTRODUCTION
With the ever-increasing growth of the on-line information and
the permeation of Internet into daily life, methods that assist users
in organizing large volumes of documents are in huge demand.
In particular, automatic text categorization has been extensively
studied recently. This categorization problem is usually viewed
as supervised learning, where the gaol is to assign predefined category
labels to unlabeled documents based on the likelihood in-ferred
from the training set of labeled documents. Numerous approaches
have been applied, including Bayesian probabilistic approaches
[20, 31], nearest neighbor [22, 19], neural networks [33],
decision trees [2], inductive rule learning [4, 9], support vector machines
[18, 14], Maximum Entropy [26], boosting [28], and linear
discriminate projection [3] (see [34] for comparative studies of text
categorization methods).
Although document collections are likely to contain many different
categories, most of the previous work was focused on binary
document classification. One of the most effective binary classification
techniques is the support vector machines (SVMs) [32]. It
has been demonstrated that the method performs superbly in binary
discriminative text classification [18, 34]. SVMs are accurate and
robust, and can quickly adapt to test instances. However, the elegant
theory behind the use of large-margin hyperplanes cannot be
easily extended to multi-class text categorization problems. A number
of techniques for reducing multi-class problems to binary problems
have been proposed, including one-versus-the-rest method,
pairwise comparison [16] and error-correcting output coding [8, 1].
In these approaches, the original problems are decomposed into a
collection of binary problems, where the assertions of the binary
classifiers are integrated to produce the final output. In practice,
which reduction method is best suited is problem-dependent, so it
is a non-trivial task to select the decomposition method. Indeed,
each reduction method has its own merits and limitations [1]. In
addition, regardless of specific details, these reduction techniques
do not appear to be well suited for text categorization tasks with
a large number of categories, because training of a single, binary
SVM requires O
і
n

µ
time for 1 7

2 1 where n is the number
of training data [17]. Thus, having to train many classifiers has
a significant impact on the overall training time. Also, the use of
multiple classifiers slows down prediction. Thus, despite its elegance
and superiority, the use of SVM may not be best suited for
multi-class document classification. However, there do not appear
to exist many alternatives, since many other techniques that can
be naturally extended to handle multi-class classification problems,
317
such as neural networks and decision trees, are not so accurate as
SVMs [34, 35].
In statistics pattern recognition literature, discriminant analysis
approaches are well known to be able to learn discriminative
feature transformations (see, e.g., [12]). For example, Fisher discriminant
analysis [10] finds a discriminative feature transformation
as eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues of matrix
T
^


1
w
^

b
, where ^

w
is the intra-class covariance matrix and
^

b
is the inter-class covariance matrix
1
. Intuitively, T captures
not only compactness of individual classes but separations among
them. Thus, eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues
of T are likely to constitute a discriminative feature transform.
However, for text categorization, ^

w
is usually singular owing to
the large number of terms. Simply removing the null space of ^

w
would eliminate important discriminant information when the projections
of ^

b
along those directions are not zeros [12]. This issue
has stymied attempts to use traditional discriminant approaches in
document analysis.
In this paper we resolve this problem. We extend discriminant
analysis and present a simple, efficient, but effective solution to
text categorization. We propose a new optimization criterion for
classification and cast text categorization as the problem of finding
transformations to reflect the inherent similarity from the data. In
this framework, given a document of unknown class membership,
we compare the distance of the new document to the centroid of
each category in the transformed space and assign it to the class
having the smallest distance to it. We call this method Generalized
Discriminant Analysis (GDA), since it uses generalized singular
value decomposition to optimize transformation. We show that the
transformation derived using
GDA
is equivalent to optimization
via the trace or determinant ratios.
GDA
has several favorable properties: First, it is simple and can
be programed in a few lines in MATLAB. Second, it is efficient.
(Most of our experiments only took several seconds.) Third, the
algorithm does not involve parameter tuning. Finally, and probably
the most importantly, it is very accurate. We have conducted extensive
experiments on various datasets to evaluate its performance.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the
related work on text categorization. Section 3 introduces our new
criterion for discriminant analysis. Section 4 introduces the basics
of generalized singular value decomposition and gives the solution
of the optimization problem. Section 5 shows that the transformation
derived using
GDA
can also be obtained by optimizing the
trace or determinant ratios. Section 6 presents some illustrating examples
. Section 7 shows experimental results. Finally, Section 8
provides conclusions and discussions.
RELATED WORK
Text categorization algorithms can be roughly classified into two
types: those algorithms that can be naturally extended to handle
multi-class cases and those require decomposition into binary classification
problems. The first consists of such algorithms as Naive
Bayes [22, 19], neural networks [25, 33], K-Nearest Neighbors [22,
19], Maximum Entropy [26] and decision trees. Naive Bayes uses
the joint distributions of words and categorizes to estimate the probabilities
that an input document belongs to each document class and
1
This is equivalent to using eigenvectors associated with the smallest
eigenvalues of matrix T

^

w
. It indicates that traditional
discriminant analysis requires the non-singularity of at least one covariance
matrix. Since the rank of ^

w
is usually greater than that of
^

b

of T

then selects the most probable class. K-Nearest Neighbor finds the
k nearest neighbors among training documents and uses the categories
of the k neighbors to determine the category of the test document
. The underlying principle of maximum entropy is that without
external knowledge, uniform distribution should be preferred.
Based on this principle, it estimate the conditional distribution of
the class label given a document.
The reduction techniques that are used by the second group include
one-versus-the-rest method [29], error-correcting output coding
[8], pairwise comparison [16], and multi-class objective functions
, where the first two have been applied to text categorization
[34, 13].
In the one-versus-the-rest method a classifier separating between
from a class and the rest is trained for each class. Multi-class classification
is carried out by integrating prediction of these individual
classifiers with a strategy for resolving conflicts. The method is
sometimes criticizes for solving asymmetric problems in a symmetrical
manner and for not considering correlations between classes.
Error-correcting output coding (ECOC) [8] partitions the original
set of classes into two sets in many different ways. A binary
classifier is trained for each partition. The partitions are carefully
chosen so that the outputs of these classifiers assign a unique binary
codeword for each class (with a large Hamming distance between
any pair of them). The class of an input with unknown class membership
is chosen by computing the outputs of the classifiers on
that input and then finding the class with the codeword closest to
the output codeword.
Although SVMs are considered to be very effective in binary
classification, its large training costs may make it unsuitable for
multi-class classification with a large number of classes if the above
decomposition techniques are applied. Also, the lack of a clear
winner among the above techniques makes the reduction task complicated
. Our
GDA
directly deals with multi-class classification
and does not require reduction to binary classification problems.
Other techniques for text categorization exist. Godbole et al.
[14] propose a new multi-class classification technique that exploits
the accuracy of SVMs and the speed of Naive Bayes. It uses a
Naive Bayes classifier to compute a confusion matrix quickly. Then
it uses this matrix to reduce both the number and the complexity
of binary SVMs to be built. Chakrabarti et al. [3] propose a fast
text classification technique that uses multiple linear projections. It
first projects training instances to low-dimensional space and then
builds decision tree classifiers on the projected spaces. Fragoudis
et al. [11] propose a new algorithm that targets both feature and
instance selection for text categorization.
In summary, as pointed out in [34, 26], there is no obvious winner
in multi-class classification techniques. For practical problems,
the choice of approach will have to be made depending on the constraints
, e.g., the desired accuracy level, the time available, and the
nature of the problem.

the null space of ^

GENERALIZED SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION
Here we will show how to use GSVD to compute efficiently the
solution to the optimization problem formulated in Section 3 and
show that the solution thus obtained is stable.
4.1
The Basics of GSVD
Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a process of decomposing
a rectangular matrix into three other matrices of a very special
form. It can be viewed as a technique for deriving a set of uncor-related
indexing variables or factors [6]. A Generalized Singular
Value Decomposition (GSVD) is an SVD of a sequence of matrices
. GSVD has played a significant role in signal processing and
in signal identification and has been widely used in such problems
as source separation, stochastic realization and generalized Gauss-Markov
estimation.
The diagonal form of GSVD, shown below, was first introduced
in [21].

The generalized singular values are defined to be the

the noise matrix, in which case the generalized singular values are
referred to as signal-noise ratios.

The above theorem gives a bound on the relative error of the
generalized eigenvalues (C

) if the difference between the
estimated covariance matrices and the genuine covariance matrices
is small. This guarantees that the relative error of

is bounded
by the relative error of estimated intra- and inter-class covariance
matrices.

accuracy. In particular, computation of the cross products

CONNECTIONS
Here we show that the above transformation derived using our
new criterion can also be obtained by optimizing the trace or determinant
ratios.
5.1
Optimizing the determinant ratio
Fisher's criterion is to maximize the ratio of the determinant of
the inter-class scatter matrix of the projected samples to the determinant
of the intra-class scatter matrix of the projected samples:

TEXT CLASSIFICATION VIA GDA EX-AMPLES
A well-known transformation method in information retrieval is
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [6], which applies Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to the document-term matrix and computes
eigenvectors having largest eigenvalues as the directions related to
the dominant combinations of the terms occurring in the dataset
(latent semantics). A transformation matrix constructed from these
eigenvectors projects a document onto the latent semantic space.
Although LSI has been proven extremely useful in information retrieval
, it is not optimal for text categorization because LSI is com-pletely
unsupervised. In other words, LSI deals with the data without
paying any particular attention to the underlying class structure
. It only aims at optimally transforming the original data into
a lower dimensional space with respect to the mean squared error
, which has nothing to do with the discrimination of the different
classes. Our
GDA
approach possesses advantages of both
discriminant analysis and of latent semantic analysis. By explic-itly
taking the intra-class and inter-class covariance matrices into
the optimization criterion,
GDA
deals directly with discrimination
between classes. Furthermore, by employing GSVD to solve the
optimization problem,
GDA
tries to identify the latent concepts
indicated by the generalized singular values.
To illustrate how well
GDA
can perform, we present here two
examples. In the first example, we compare
GDA
against LDA and
LSI. Figure 1 shows a small dataset consisting of nine phrases in
three topics: user interaction, graph theory, and distributed systems.

enough to obtain good insights as to how
GDA
performs. Table 2
summarizes the characteristics of the datasets.
20Newsgroups
The 20Newsgroups (20NG) dataset contains
approximately 20,000 articles evenly divided among 20 Usenet
newsgroups. The raw text size is 26MB. All words were stemmed
using a porter stemming program, all HTML tags were skipped,
and all header fields except subject and organization of the posted
article were ignored.
WebKB
The WebKB dataset
3
contains Web pages collected
from university computer science departments. There are approximately
8,300 documents in the set and they are divided into seven
categories: student, faculty, staff, course, project, department, and
other. The raw text size of the dataset is 27MB. Among the seven
categories, student, faculty, course, and project are the four most
populous. The subset consisting only of these categories is also
used here, which is called WebKB4. In neither of the datasets, we
used stemming or stop lists.
Industry
Sector
The
Industry
Section
dataset
4
is
based on the data made available by Market Guide, Inc.
(www.marketguide.com). The set consists of company homepages
that are categorized in a hierarchy of industry sectors, but we
disregarded the hierarchy. There were 9,637 documents in the
dataset, which were divided into 105 classes. We tokened the
documents by skipping all MIME and HTML headers and using a
standard stop list. We did not perform stemming.
Reuters
The Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Test Collection
contains documents collected from the Reuters newswire in
1987. It is a standard text categorization benchmark and contains
135 categories. We used its subsets: one consisting of the ten most
frequent categories, which we call Reuters-Top10, and the other
consisting of documents associated with a single topic, which we
call Reuters-2. Reuters-2 had approximately 9,000 documents and
50 categories.
TDT2
TDT2 is the NIST Topic Detection and Tracking text
corpus version 3.2 released in December 6, 1999 [30]. This corpus
contains news data collected daily from nine news sources in
two languages (American English and Mandarin Chinese), over a
period of six months (January≠June in 1998). We used only the
English news texts, which were collected from New York Times
Newswire Service, Associated Press Worldstream Service, Cable
News Network, Voice of America, American Broadcasting Company
, and Public Radio International. The documents were manu-ally
annotated using 96 target topics. We selected the documents
having annotated topics and removed the brief texts. The resulting

dataset contained 7,980 documents.
K-dataset
This dataset was obtained from the WebACE
project [15]. It contained 2,340 documents consisting of news articles
from Reuters News Service made available on the Web in October
1997. These documents were divided into 20 classes. They
were processed by eliminating stop words and HTML tags, stemming
the remaining words using Porter's suffix-stripping algorithm.
CSTR
This is the dataset of the abstracts of technical reports
published in the Department of Computer Science at the University
of Rochester between 1991 and 2002
5
. The dataset contained 476
abstracts, which were divided into four research areas: Symbolic-AI
, Spatial-AI, Systems, and Theory. We processed the abstracts
by removing stop words and applying stemming operations on the
remaining words.

Data Preprocessing
In all experiments, we randomly chose 70% of the documents for
training and assigned the rest for testing. It is suggested in [35] that
information gain is effective for term removal and it can remove up
to 90% or more of the unique terms without performance degrade.
So, we first selected the top 1,000 words by information gain with
class labels. The feature selection is done with the Rainbow package
[23].
Here we use classification accuracy for evaluation. Different
measures, such as precision-recall graphs and F
1
measure [34],
have been used in the literature. However, since the datasets used
in our experiments are relatively balanced and single-labeled, and
our goal in text categorization is to achieve low misclassification
rates and high separation between different classes on a test set,
we thought that accuracy is the best measure of performance. All
of our experiments were carried out on a P4 2GHz machine with
512M memory running Linux 2.4.9-31.
7.3
Experimental Results
Now we present and discuss the experimental results. Here we
compare
GDA
against Naive Bayes (NB for short), K-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN for short), Maximum Entropy (ME for short),
LDA, and SVM on the same datasets with the same training and
testing data. Recall that the first three of the methods we compare
against are commonly-used direct methods for multi-class classification
(in the sense that they do not require reduction to binary
classification problems). For experiments involving SVM we used
SVMTorch [5]
6
, which uses the one-versus-the-rest decomposition.
Table 3 and Figure 5 show performance comparisons.
GDA
outperformed all the other five methods on 20NG, WebKB4, WebKB
and Industry Sector. SVM performed the best on Reuters-2,

K-dataset, and TDT2.
GDA
outperformed LDA on all the experiments
, and the improvement was significant (more than 10%) when
the sample size was relatively small (in the case of CSTR, Reuters-Top10
, and K-dataset).
On 20NG, the performance of
GDA
s 95 03%, which is approximately
10% higher than that of NB, 6% higher than that of ME,
and 4% higher than that of SVM. On the WebKB4 dataset,
GDA
beats NB by approximately 5%, and both ME and SVM by approximately
2%. On the WebKB dataset,
GDA
beats NB by approximately
16% and ME by 6%. The performance of
GDA
is about
8% higher than that of NB and by 6% than that of ME on the Industry
Sector. The results with
GDA
and with SVM are almost
the same on WebKB, Industry Sector, Reuters-Top10, and CSTR.
On Reuters-2, K-dataset, and TDT2, SVM performs slightly better
than
GDA
by 3%. ME achieves the best results on the CSTR
dataset while NB is the winner on Reuters-top10 in terms of performance
On CSTR, the performance of
GDA
is 2% lower than that
of NB and 4% lower than that of ME. On Reuters-Top10,
GDA
is beaten by NB by approximately 1%. In total, the performance
of
GDA
is always either the winner or very close to the winner:
it is ranked the first four times, ranked the second three times, and
ranked the third in the remaining two. Although there is no single
winner over all datasets,
GDA
seems to outperform the rest on
most counts. We can say that
GDA
is a viable, competitive algorithm
in text categorization.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented
GDA
, a simple, efficient, and yet accurate
, direct approach to multi-class text categorization.
GDA
utilizes
GSVD to transform the original data into a new space, which
could reflect the inherent similarities between classes based on a
new optimization criterion. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate
its efficiency and effectiveness.
Interestingly enough, although traditional discriminant approaches
have been successfully applied in pattern recognition, little
work has been reported on document analysis. As we mentioned
earlier, this is partly because the intra-class covariance matrix is
usually singular for document-term data and hence restrict the usage
of discriminant. Our new criterion avoids the problem while
still preserving the discriminative power of the covariance matrix.
323
Another big barrier to application of discriminant analysis in document
classification is its large computation cost. As we know,
traditional discriminant analysis requires a large amount of computation
on matrix inversion, SVD, and eigenvalue-analysis. The
costs of these operations are extremely large in document analysis
because the matrices have thousands of dimension. Our approach
makes use of effective feature selection via information gain, with
which we can remove up to 90% or more of the unique terms without
significant performance degrade [35]. One of our future plans
is to explore how the performance correlates with different feature
selection methods and the number of words selected. There are also
other possible extensions such as using random projection to reduce
the dimensionality before applying discriminant analysis [27].
